# AMAZON RAIN FOREST ANALYSIS
This analysis aims to uncover key insights that could help improve fire management strategies and better understand the ecological challenges in the Amazon, which can help preserve the rainforest and mitigate climate change.
##
I have used Jupyter Notebook for analyzing the Amazon rain forest data with the help of pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries.

## Data Overview
The dataset provides fire occurrence data in the Amazon rainforest between 1998 and 2017. 
It consists of five columns:\
**year**: Year of the recorded fire\
**state**: the state where the fire was reported\
**month**: Month in which the fire occurred\
**number**: Number of fires reported in that specific month\
**date**: The particular date of the fire report
